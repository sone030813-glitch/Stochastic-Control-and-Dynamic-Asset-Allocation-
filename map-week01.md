Stochastic Calculus & Finance (Week 1 Summary)1. Itô's Formula & The "Box" CalculusThe Golden Rule (Multiplication Table)$dW \cdot dW = dt$ (Crucial: Brownian motion squared is deterministic time)$dt \cdot dW = 0$ (Cross terms vanish)$dt \cdot dt = 0$ (Higher order time terms vanish)Reasoning: $\Delta W \approx \sqrt{\Delta t}$, so $(\Delta W)^2 \approx \Delta t$.The Mechanical Routine (3 Steps)Compute partial derivatives: $f_t$, $f_x$, $f_{xx}$.Substitute $dX = \mu dt + \sigma dW$.Collect $dt$ terms and $dW$ terms (using the Multiplication Table).Convexity AdjustmentThe extra term $\frac{1}{2} f_{xx} (dX)^2$ appears because standard calculus ignores curvature.Since Brownian motion is "jagged," this second-order term ($\sigma^2 dt$) cannot be ignored.2. Key Derivations (The "Two Must-Knows")Case A: Log-Price ($\ln S$)Function: $f(S) = \ln S$ (Concave shape $\cap$).Second Derivative: $f_{xx} = -1/S^2$ (Negative).Result: Drift decreases.Formula: $d(\ln S) = (\mu - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)dt + \sigma dW$.Meaning: This transforms Geometric Brownian Motion into a Normal Distribution.Case B: Inverse Price ($1/S$)Function: $f(S) = 1/S$ (Convex shape $\cup$).Second Derivative: $f_{xx} = 2/S^3$ (Positive).Result: Drift increases (Jensen's Inequality).Formula: $d(1/S) = \frac{1}{S}(\sigma^2 - \mu)dt - \frac{\sigma}{S}dW$.Core Difference: The sign of $f_{xx}$ determines if we add or subtract drift.3. The Product Rule (Integration by Parts)The Skeleton Formula (Always Fixed)$d(XY) = X dY + Y dX + dX dY$The "Cross Term" ($dX dY$) CalculationThis term is not fixed; it depends on the source of randomness.Scenario 1 (Same Noise): If both have $dW$, then $dX dY = \sigma_1 \sigma_2 dt$.Scenario 2 (Independent Noise): If $dW_1 \perp dW_2$, then $dX dY = 0$.Scenario 3 (Deterministic): If one process has no $dW$ (e.g., Time $t$ or Bond $B$), then $dX dY = 0$.4. Financial Concepts & ApplicationIsolate the DriftTechnique: Group all terms with $dt$ into one bracket.Goal: To check if the process is a Martingale.Rule: If Drift (coefficient of $dt$) is 0, the process is a Martingale (Fair Game).Origin of Parameters$\mu$ comes from the Stock definition: $dS = \mu S dt + \sigma S dW$.$r$ comes from the Bond definition: $dB = r B dt$.Example: Discounted Stock Price ($S/B$)Using Product Rule on $S \cdot B^{-1}$.Drift changes from $\mu$ to $(\mu - r)$.Under Risk-Neutral Measure ($Q$), we force $\mu = r$ so the drift becomes 0.5. Definitions (From Lecture Notes)Martingale: $E[M_t | \mathcal{F}_s] = M_s$ (Best prediction of future is current value).Arbitrage: Making profit with zero probability of loss ("Free Lunch").Replication: Mimicking a derivative's payoff using a trading strategy of underlying assets.
