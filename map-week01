Phase 1: Conceptual Understanding (Sections 1.1 – 1.5)Goal: Understand what a control problem looks like before learning how to solve it mathematically.Action: Read through the examples to grasp the recurring structure: Dynamics (how the system evolves) + Objective (what you want to maximize/minimize).Start with Section 1.1: It uses a simple die-rolling game to introduce "working backwards" (Dynamic Programming)1.Focus on Section 1.2 (Merton’s Problem): This is the classic financial model. Pay attention to how the "Wealth Process" SDE is derived and the different types of Utility functions (Log, Power, Exponential)2222.Skim Sections 1.3 & 1.4: These show more complex applications like "Optimal Liquidation" and "Systemic Risk." Don't worry about the solution details yet; just understand the setup3333.Phase 2: Formal Definitions (Section 1.6)Goal: Learn the language of the course.Action: This section formalizes the patterns you saw in Phase 1. You must memorize the five key components of a stochastic control problem defined here4:Time Horizon: Finite ($[0,T]$) vs. Infinite5.State Process ($X_t$): usually an SDE controlled by $\alpha$6.Control Process ($\alpha_t$): The strategy you choose7.Objective Function ($J$): The expected cost or gain8.Value Function ($v$): The best possible outcome achievable9.Phase 3: Technical Skills (Section 1.7 Exercises)Goal: Refresh the stochastic analysis tools required to solve SDEs.Action: Do not skip these. The notes explicitly state their aim is to "build confidence in manipulating the basic objects"10.Must-Do Exercises:Ex 1.14 (Geometric Brownian Motion): Practice applying Itô's formula to solve SDEs11.Ex 1.16 (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck): Another classic process you will encounter often12.Ex 1.9 (Gronwall's Lemma): Essential for proving estimates and uniqueness later13.Which Section is the Most Important?Section 1.6: Basic elements of a stochastic control problem is the most important section conceptually.Why? It provides the universal framework for every problem you will solve in this course. Whether you are dealing with stock portfolios (Merton), bank reserves (Systemic Risk), or inventory (Liquidation), they all map back to the definitions in Section 1.6: defining the Admissible Controls, the State Dynamics, and the Value Function. If you do not understand these definitions, you cannot set up the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations in Units 4 and 5.Honorable Mention:Section 1.2 (Merton's Problem) is the most important example. It is referenced repeatedly throughout the course (e.g., Example 4.12, Exercise 4.18) as a benchmark for testing new theories.
